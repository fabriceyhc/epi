**Analysis Number**: 07
**Script**: `07_covid_impact.py`
**Status**: ✅ Verified with actual results
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-05

## Overview
Basic analysis of COVID-19 pandemic impact on overdose deaths, comparing pre-pandemic,
pandemic, and post-pandemic periods.

## Outputs Generated

### Visualizations
- `age_by_period.png`
- `overall_impact.png`
- `pandemic_timeline.png`
- `period_comparison.png`
- `polysubstance_by_period.png`
- `substances_by_period.png`

### Data Tables
- `annual_deaths.csv`
  - 12 rows, 2 columns
- `period_comparison.csv`
  - 3 rows, 4 columns
- `polysubstance_by_period.csv`
  - 3 rows, 4 columns
- `substances_by_period.csv`
  - 24 rows, 4 columns


## Key Findings

### Period Comparisons
- Review `period_comparison.csv` for pre/during/post COVID stats
- Check `annual_deaths.csv` for yearly trends
- Document 2020 spike magnitude

### Age Distribution Changes
- Examine `age_by_period.csv`
- Note if age profile shifted during pandemic

### Substance Changes
- Review `substances_by_period.csv`
- Check `polysubstance_by_period.csv`
- Document fentanyl surge during COVID
- Note polysubstance increases

### Impact Magnitude
- Calculate percent change from pre-COVID baseline
- Compare 2019 vs 2020 vs 2021
- Note sustained elevation in 2021-2022

**Note**: See Analysis #23 for comprehensive COVID economic shock analysis with detailed racial/SES breakdown.

## Methodology

- Defines periods: Pre-COVID (2012-2019), COVID (2020-2021), Post-COVID (2022-2023)
- Compares death counts and rates across periods
- Analyzes age and substance distribution changes
- Tracks polysubstance involvement by period
- Creates timeline and comparison visualizations
