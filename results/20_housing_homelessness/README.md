# Housing Burden and Homelessness Pipeline

## Overview
Examines the relationship between rising housing costs, homelessness, and overdose deaths. Links housing affordability crisis to overdose vulnerability.

## Key Findings

### Housing Cost Increases (2012-2023)
- **Median rent**: +61.4% ($1,175 → $1,896/month)
- **Median home value**: +107.4% ($399,500 → $828,700)

### Homelessness Among Overdose Deaths
**By race (2012-2023 average):**
- **BLACK**: 16.3% experiencing homelessness
- **WHITE**: 11.4% experiencing homelessness
- **LATINE**: 8.2% experiencing homelessness

### Substance Patterns by Housing Status
**Unhoused vs Housed:**
- **Methamphetamine**: 64.2% (unhoused) vs 39.0% (housed)
- Unhoused individuals show significantly higher meth involvement

### Rent Burden by Race (2023)
- **BLACK**: 37.5% of income spent on rent
- **LATINE**: 30.0%
- **ASIAN**: 22.7%
- **WHITE**: 21.3%

### Interpretation
Rising housing costs create economic stress that may contribute to overdose risk. Black populations face the highest housing cost burden, and homelessness is strongly associated with methamphetamine use in overdose deaths.
